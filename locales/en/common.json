    "heading2": "Atelier Honis",
    "description": "The idea of opening a furniture production company came from the experience of furnishing our own apartment, where we faced difficulties in collaborating with carpenters who did not provide professional consultancy, 3D design, or a reasonable execution time. Following this traditional model of working with a carpenter, until the complete furniture was finalized, the process proved to be extremely laborious, involving numerous trips between different stores to purchase chipboard, MDF, hardware, as well as for cutting and edging services."

We bring all these services together in one place to save you precious time. Instead of traveling between different stores, you can discuss all the details with a single consultant, which reduces wasted time and optimizes the execution process. This way, you can obtain furniture without stress."
